# Supply-Chain-Risk-Profitability-Analysis

**Project Overview**

This data analytics project focuses on identifying bottlenecks and risks within a global supply chain using the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset. The goal is to analyze delivery performance, financial impact, and regional logistics efficiency to provide actionable business insights.

**Key Findings**

Based on the data analysis, the following critical insights were identified:

**The First Class Failure:** Analysis reveals a major inefficiency in 'First Class' shipping, where the delay probability is over 95%, significantly higher than 'Standard Class' which stands at approximately 35%.

**Critical Regions:** Supply chain networks in Central Asia and Africa are highly unstable, showing the highest density of red zones in risk probability.

**Product Risk:** High-volume categories like Cleats and Men's Footwear face the most frequent shipping delays, impacting overall customer satisfaction.

**Financial Impact:** Late deliveries and cancellations are major drivers of negative profit (loss), as seen in the profit distribution analysis.

**Tech Stack & Skills**

**Language**: Python

**Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Data Analytics Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Pivot Analysis, Risk Mapping (Heatmaps), Financial Distribution Analysis.

**Visualizations**

**1. Logistics Risk Heatmap**

The heatmap identifies "Red Zones" where the probability of late delivery is near 1.00 (100%), specifically in First Class shipping across almost all regions.

**2. Profit Distribution (Boxplot)**

Shows the spread of profit per order across different delivery statuses, highlighting the financial risk associated with 'Late delivery' and 'Shipping canceled'.

**Business Recommendations**

**Carrier Audit:** Conduct a thorough audit of 'First Class' logistics partners to identify why premium shipping is underperforming.

**Regional Optimization:** Restructure the supply chain network in Central Asia and Africa by potentially shifting to more reliable local carriers.

**Inventory Management:** Implement priority processing for high-risk categories like 'Cleats' to reduce warehouse handling time.
